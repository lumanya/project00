        <h5>USE YOUR FAITH</h5>
        <blockquote class="blockquote">Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word
                    of God..<footer class="blockquote-footer"><cite>Hebrews 11:3</cite></footer>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Some people think it's nice and humble to always cry to God for help. they think God
            that God loves their "dependency syndrome," but He doesn't.Rather, He wants you to effect changes in 
            your life and circumstances with the word of faith on your lips. it reminds of a situation
            with Jesus and His disciples as they sailed in a boat.<br>The Master had fallen asleep
            in the rear of the boat, and the Bible says, <i>"...there came down a storm of wind on the
            the lake; and they were filled with water, and were in jeopardy" (Luke 8:23)</i>
            <br>The disciples ran to him in utter desperation and said, "Master , master, we perish."
            the Master, after rebuking the raging tempest, turned to them and said, "where is your faith?"
            (Read Luke 8:23-25). He made them realize they could have done something about the situation
            without necessarily coming to Him.<br>He said in Matthew 17:20,<i> "...If ye have faith" as grain of
            mustard seed...nothing shall be impossible unto you."</i> With your faith, you can chart the course of your life
             to align with God's will and purpose for you. It makes no difference what has happened or is happening wityh your finance, job
              and health or in any area of your life; dont fret or cry for help!<br>Repair, arrange and reconstruct things in line with
              God's perfect will with your confession of faith. With your faith you can frame your in the path of groly and excellence.
              The Bible says our faith is the victory that overcome the world: "..this is the victory that ovecometh the world, even our faith"(1 John 5:4)
              <br>There's no situation that your faith can't handle. that's why Jesus asked His disciples when they panicked
              during crisis, "Where is your faith?" Whatever confronts you today is nmo match for your faith.
              Change the narrative with your faith-filled confession. Speak, keep speaking, and you'll surely see the change that
              you desire, because Jesus said, <i>"You shall have what you say"(Mark 11:23</i>
