                Take a lesson from the ants, you lazy fellow. Learn from their ways
                and be wise! For though they have no king to make them work, yet they
                labor hard all summer, gathering food for the winter

            <P>Finacial discipline is very important, and its something the spirit of 
                God can train you in. Some don't realize they're not supposed to spend 
                everything they get. Simple wisdom is that you spend less than you earn
                 or receive; otherwise you could end up in debt.
                 <br>
                 The response of some to this might be, "what i earn isn't enough even 
                 ; after paying my tithe, giving my offering and doing other things i need
                 to do, nothing is left." No; do'nt think or talk like that
                 <br>
                 First, understand that you're  the seed of Abraham; therefore, your financil
                  prosperity is indepedent of how much you earn or the economic situation around
                  . You're  an heir of God and joint-heir with Christ; You're plugged to an
                  unending supply. Thus, the idea of cultivating the habit to save isn't
                  about keeping your money in the bank to accumulate interest; it's about discipline
            </P>
            <p>Proverbs 21:20 TLB says <i>"the wise man saves for the future, but the foolish man
                spends whatever he gets."</i> you may say, "what essense of saving of saving a small
                amount; it's not going anywhere." Don't destroy it with your mouth. Never declare that what
                you have is small or not enough.
                <br>
                Money is spiritual; it's not that coin or note in your 
                pocket, wallet or bank account. Money has hears can hear you. So you must learn to bless
                your finances.
                <br>
                The issue isn't the size of your income, but the size of your mind-your thinking, and what your faith
                 can produce. Think about how much you might have received in the last one year; but then
                 , how much of it did you reproduce? If your answer isn't satisfactory, it's time for a change
                 . 
                 <br>
                 As long as the things you put money into aren't such that can reproduce what you
                  put in and more, then there's a problem, and it's ecpedient that you change things. God's
                  Word impart wisdom to you for financial intelligence and discipline. So, study and meditate
                   on the Word more, and you'll always deal wisely in handling your finances.
