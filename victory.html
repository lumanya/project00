        <h5>SEE VICTORIES AND POSSIBILITIES</h5>
        <blockquote>The caleb quited the people before Moses. and said,
            Let us go up at once and take possession, for we are well able to overcome it
            (Numbers 13:30 NKJV).
        </blockquote>

        <p>Numbers 13 tells the story of how God, instricting Moses to send a man out of every tribe
            to spy out the land of canaan. These twelve men were to infiltrate canaan and report back to moses.
            However, when they returned to the camp with the feedback of their surveillance, they all confirmed the land
             of canaan to be magnificent country-a land flowing with milk and honey-and even presented
             some of its fruit as proof. <br>But quite sadly, ten out of twelve spies bewailed their weakness,
             and how the inhabitants of canaan were fierce, and how huge and well fortified their cities were.
             <br>worse yet, they lamented how fear gripped their hearton sighting the descendant of the giant,
             Anak in the land.Read their distressing report in Numbers 13:31,33. This news of gloom of how the land devours
              its inhabitants aroused discouragements in the hearts of the israelities. But two of these spies
              -caleb and joshua spoke diffently.They saw victories and possibilities; therefore, they interrupted the people saying
              ,"..Let us go up at once and take possession, for we are well able to overcome it"(Numbers 13:30)
              <br>They further charged the assembly, "Just don't rebel against God! And don't be afraid of those people. Why, we will have
              them for launch! They have no protection and God is on our side.Don't be afraid of them!"(Numbers 14:9 MSG).
              <br>Never be intimidated by your detractors and adversaries. If you're a business person for example, don't
              wallow in deep thoughts about how influential your competitors are or get intimidated by the high rise
               conglomerates close to you. <br>Don't become unsettled at the many bluechip multinationals you have to contend with.
               you're the seed of Abraham; therefore, you have the advantage.See and talk differently.See through the eyes of the spirit
               .See through the word.Irrespective of the daunting challenges that may stare you in the face, see your victory, succeess,your triumphs
               and your achivements.Praise God!

        </p>
